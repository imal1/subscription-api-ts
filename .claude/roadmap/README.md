# MioBridge Roadmap

This is the compact planning reference. Keep detailed architecture and operating
rules in `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and `.Codex/memory/`.

## Status

- ✅ Shipped
- 🟡 Partial or active
- 🔲 Planned
- ⏸ Deferred

## Version Summary

| Version | Theme | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| v0.1 | Minimum usable subscription converter | ✅ | Single Next.js service, mihomo conversion, generated outputs, SSR dashboard |
| v0.2 | AI memory and contributor docs | ✅ | Moved durable memory to `.Codex/memory/`; docs were intentionally shortened |
| v1.0 | Distributed node control plane | ✅ | Main node, Agent, HMAC, NodeManager, remote deployment, adapters |
| v1.1 | Auth and API keys | ⏸ | Deferred while the product is single-user; revisit before public/multi-user use |
| v1.2 | Online config management | 🟡 | Config view exists; safe edit, validation, backup, rollback still needed |
| v1.3 | Subscription source management | 🔲 | Remote URLs, manual input, file upload, source health, dedupe |
| v1.4 | Output customization and rules | 🔲 | Clash templates, proxy groups, DNS, rule editing, export variants |
| v1.5 | Monitoring and alerts | 🟡 | Logs UI exists; metrics, history, alert rules, webhook notifications pending |
| v1.6 | API docs and API consistency | 🟡 | API page exists; OpenAPI spec, zod validation, standard errors pending |
| v1.7 | Performance and cache | 🔲 | Artifact caching, update locks, SSE/progress, cleanup jobs |
| v1.8 | Production quality | 🟡 | Unit tests exist; coverage gates, E2E, CI test job, reports still pending |

## Current Direction

The near-term product is single-user. Prioritize a complete local/control-plane
experience over account systems:

1. Make Mio Garden the primary web control surface.
2. Keep all UI on shadcn/ui primitives, Iconify icons, Botanical Garden tokens,
   and focused motion interactions.
3. Prefer direct service calls in SSR and thin API routes.
4. Preserve compatibility URLs: `/subscription.txt`, `/clash.yaml`, `/raw.txt`,
   and `/health`.

## Shipped Baseline

v0.1 and v1.0 form the stable baseline:

- Next.js Pages Router full-stack app under `frontend/`.
- Runtime data under `~/.config/miobridge`.
- Main node generates `raw.txt`, `subscription.txt`, and `clash.yaml`.
- Child nodes run Agent/kernel and expose source URLs.
- Remote checks use public Agent HTTP plus HMAC; SSH is for deploy/diagnosis.
- GitHub Actions build standalone output and deploy atomically.

## Active Work

### Mio Garden UI

- Replace the old dashboard-first flow with task pages: overview,
  subscription, nodes, deploy, logs, config, and API.
- Keep the panel style flat and Material 3 inspired: elevated/filled surfaces,
  no visible borders, contrast through lighter botanical surfaces.
- Use shadcn/ui components for inputs, tabs, charts, dialogs, resizable panels,
  toasts, tables, and badges.

### Config Management

Goal: edit runtime config without SSH.

Acceptance:

- Read/write `~/.config/miobridge/config.yaml` through service APIs.
- Validate YAML and supported fields before write.
- Backup before every write and support rollback.
- Hot-reload safe fields such as source lists, cron, log level, and timeouts.
- Clearly mark fields that require service restart.

### Subscription Sources

Goal: stop relying on only local sing-box config names.

Acceptance:

- Support sing-box config, remote URL, manual text, and uploaded node files.
- Test each source before saving.
- Track last status, node count, latency, and failure reason.
- Dedupe nodes and support simple rename/filter rules.

### Output Customization

Goal: let users shape generated Clash output.

Acceptance:

- Provide several built-in templates.
- Allow proxy group and rule editing.
- Validate generated `clash.yaml` with mihomo.
- Export YAML, install URL, and QR code where useful.

### Observability

Goal: diagnose from the web UI before SSH.

Acceptance:

- Search and filter logs by level, time, and keyword.
- Record update history, duration, node count, and errors.
- Add `/api/metrics` or equivalent structured metrics.
- Add dashboard alerts and optional webhook notifications.

### API and Quality

Goal: make the service easier to integrate and safer to change.

Acceptance:

- Publish OpenAPI documentation for stable endpoints.
- Standardize API errors and request validation.
- Add unit, integration, and E2E coverage for key flows.
- Include tests in CI once stable enough to gate PRs.

## Deferred

Auth, API key management, multi-user accounts, quotas, billing, plugin markets,
and hosted-platform features are not near-term priorities. Revisit auth before
opening an instance beyond trusted single-user access.

## Future Ideas

- Docker image and one-command install path.
- Multi-language UI/docs.
- Additional protocol parsers.
- Template marketplace for Clash rules and output profiles.
